# WordCamp Lehigh Vallely 2018 Theme

This is the theme used for WordCamp Lehigh Valley's 2018 website. The compiled CSS is loaded by the lehighvalley.wordcamp.org site, while the child theme itself can be used in a local development environment. This CSS file is already set up in WordCamp Lehigh Valley's Remote CSS setting, so any change in this repo will be automatically synced to the live site.
