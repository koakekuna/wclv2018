# WordCamp Lehigh Vallely 2018 Theme

## Intro

The theme used for WordCamp Lehigh Valley's 2018 website is [CampSite 2017](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/05/08/the-new-wordcamp-base-theme-campsite-2017/) and is a starter theme based on [_s](https://underscores.me/). It offers 23 widget areas and a new *Day of Event* template, making it easier to highlight the most important info for attendees during the WordCamp.

We are using Remote CSS and a webhook in this repo to automatically sync the root style.css file with the WordCamp.org [site](https://2018.lehighvalley.wordcamp.org/). That means everytime a change is pushed, our styles will be downloaded, sanitized, minified, stored as a local copy, then enqueued as a stylesheet alongsie the theme's default stylesheet.
